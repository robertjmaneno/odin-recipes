    <h3>Discription</h3>
    <p>Cheese is a dairy product made from curdled milk, <br>typically from cows, goats, or sheep, that undergoes<br> various processes such as fermentation, aging, and pressing, <br>resulting in a wide range of flavors, textures, and types, making it a versatile<br> ingredient used in various cuisines around the world.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
<li>1 gallon (3.8 liters) of milk (can use cow's milk, goat's milk, or sheep's milk)</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon mesophilic starter culture (specific to the type of cheese you want to make)</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon calcium chloride (if using pasteurized milk)</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon liquid rennet (vegetable or animal-based)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon cheese salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
<li>Heat and culture: Heat the milk, add mesophilic starter culture, and let it sit for a few minutes to rehydrate.</li>
<li>Add rennet: Dissolve liquid rennet in water, add it to the milk, and stir gently.</li>
<li>Form curds: Let the milk sit undisturbed until it forms a clean break, then cut the curds into small cubes.</li>
<li>Cook and stir: Heat the curds slowly while stirring gently to reach the target temperature.</li>
<li>Mold and press: Ladle the curds into molds lined with cheesecloth, sprinkle with salt, and press with weight.</li>
<li>Shape and consolidate: Let the cheese sit at room temperature, periodically flipping and repressing it.</li>
<li>Age: Optionally, age the cheese in a cool, humid environment for the recommended time.</li>
<li>Unmold and unwrap: Remove the cheese from the molds and carefully unwrap the cheesecloth.</li>
<li>Optional brining: Some cheeses benefit from being immersed in a brine solution for added flavor and preservation. If desired, prepare a brine solution according to the recipe and soak the cheese for the recommended time.</li>
<li>Aging: Transfer the cheese to a cool, humid environment such as a cheese cave or refrigerator. Age the cheese for the specified duration, turning it periodically to ensure even aging.</li>
<li>Monitoring and care: During the aging process, monitor the cheese for any signs of mold or spoilage. Maintain the appropriate temperature and humidity conditions recommended for the cheese type.</li>
<li>Taste and enjoy: Once the aging period is complete, your cheese is ready to be enjoyed! Slice it, grate it, or incorporate it into your favorite dishes.</li>
