    <h3>Discription</h3>
     <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish consisting of alternating <br> layers of pasta sheets, rich tomato sauce, cheese, and various<br> fillings, baked to perfection.</p>
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Ground meat (typically beef or pork)</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce or marinara sauce</li>
        <li>Cheese (such as mozzarella, ricotta, or Parmesan)</li>
        <li>Seasonings (such as garlic, oregano, and basil)</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Steps</h3>
     <ol>
<li>Preheat your oven to the recommended temperature (usually around 375°F or 190°C).</li>
<li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
<li>In a skillet, cook the ground meat until browned. Drain any excess fat.</li>
<li>Add tomato sauce or marinara sauce to the cooked meat and stir well. Season with herbs and spices to taste.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, mix together the cheeses (mozzarella, ricotta, and Parmesan) to create the cheese filling.</li>
<li>Grease a baking dish and begin layering the lasagna. Start with a layer of noodles, followed by a layer of the meat sauce, and then a layer of the cheese filling. Repeat the layers until you've used all the ingredients, ending with a layer of cheese on top.</li>
<li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the cheese on top is bubbly and golden.</li>
<li>Once done, let the lasagna rest for a few minutes before serving to allow it to set.</li>
<li>Slice and serve the delicious homemade lasagna!</li>
