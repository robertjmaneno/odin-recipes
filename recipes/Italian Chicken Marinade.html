    <h3>Discription</h3>
     <p>Italian chicken marinated with a blend of <br>olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, and<br> Italian seasoning, resulting in tender and flavorful grilled chicken.</p>
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
    <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
<li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
<li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
<li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
<li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil (optional)</li>
     </ul>

     <h3>Steps</h3>
     <ol>
<li>In a bowl, whisk together the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, minced garlic, Italian seasoning, salt, black pepper, lemon juice, and fresh basil (if using).</li>
<li>Place the chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish.</li>
<li>Pour the marinade over the chicken, ensuring it is well-coated. If using a bag, seal it tightly. If using a dish, cover it with plastic wrap.</li>
<li>Place the marinated chicken in the refrigerator and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, or ideally, up to 4 hours to allow the flavors to develop.</li>
<li>When you're ready to cook the chicken, preheat your grill or stovetop grill pan over medium-high heat.</li>
<li>Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard the excess marinade.</li>
<li>Grill the chicken for about 6-8 minutes per side, or until it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C) and is cooked through.</li> The cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the chicken breasts.</li>
<li>Once cooked, remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
<li>Serve the Italian-marinated chicken with your favorite sides or in salads, sandwiches, or pasta dishes.</li>
     </ol>
